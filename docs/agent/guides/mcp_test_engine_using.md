# Using the MCP Test Engine (AI Agent Quick Guide)

MCP lives in `./support/mcp`. It wraps the Playwright BDD stack as an MCP server/bridge so agents can run steps. Always start a session first, then execute steps.

## Start the MCP server (Playwright-backed)
- Headed, keep-alive (good for debugging):  
  ```bash
  yarn test:mcp:headed
  ```
- Headless, stop when spec ends:  
  ```bash
  MCP_KEEP_ALIVE=0 E2E_HEADLESS=1 yarn test:mcp
  ```
The server prints `MCP server listening at http://localhost:<port>` and logs under `support/mcp/logs/`.

## STDIO - SSE bridge (for stdio-only clients)
```bash
npx tsx support/mcp/bridge-cli.ts
```
Bootstrap tools available before connecting: `session_start_new`, `attach_existing_session`. Everything else returns "Session not started" until a session is active. To connect to a server launched via the debug step, call `attach_existing_session` (reads latest port file from `support/mcp/logs/ports/`).

## Tool contract (call these over MCP)
- `session_start_new` (required first): `{ "sessionName": "My run", "headless": true|false }` — regenerates step YAMLs in `support/mcp/steps/`, opens app page.
- `step_execute_single` (primary): `{ "stepText": "I click element with label \"Login\"" , "stepDocstring": "..."? }` — run exactly one step; use for diagnostics or value-returning steps.
- `step_execute_many` (only for 2+ steps): `{ "steps": [ { "stepText": "I open site \"<baseUrl>\"" }, { "stepText": "I click button \"Login\"" } ] }` — no per-step results, do not use for single steps.
- `attach_existing_session`: attach bridge to an already running MCP server (e.g., started via debug step `When I start the MCP test engine`).

**Important**: Prefer `step_execute_single` for all single actions, diagnostic steps, and steps that return values. Use `step_execute_many` only when you truly need 2+ sequential steps with no per-step output.

## Example MCP calls
- Start a session (stdio/JSON-RPC):
```json
{ "method": "tools/call", "params": { "name": "session_start_new", "arguments": { "sessionName": "demo", "headless": true } } }
```
- Run one diagnostic step:
```json
{ "method": "tools/call", "params": { "name": "step_execute_single", "arguments": { "stepText": "I analyze current page" } } }
```
- Run multiple steps:
```json
{ "method": "tools/call", "params": { "name": "step_execute_many", "arguments": { "steps": [ { "stepText": "I open site \"<baseUrl>\"" }, { "stepText": "I click element with label \"Login\"" } ] } } }
```

## Diagnostics and step catalog
- Step definitions are loaded from `./steps/**` plus `support/mcp/sd/**` (e.g., `When I analyze current page`, `I get accessibility snapshot of "role=button"`). They are rebuilt on every `session_start_new`.
- Generated YAML catalogs live in `support/mcp/steps/` with categories, source, and line numbers — send them to the LLM for discovery.
- Screenshots and diagnostics are saved under `support/mcp/screenshots/`. Ports recorded in `support/mcp/logs/ports/`.

## Shutdown and cleanup
- Graceful: send `notifications/shutdown` or stop the Playwright run; bridge will forward shutdown.
- Force kill (if zombie processes): `./support/mcp/kill-mcp.sh`.

## Rules of thumb for agents
- Always call `session_start_new` (or `attach_existing_session` with a saved port) before any step execution.
- Prefer `step_execute_single` for all single actions/diagnostics/returns; use `step_execute_many` only when you truly need multiple steps with no per-step output.
- If step definitions change, restart the session to refresh YAMLs.
- Avoid CSS/XPath-only selectors — update the app layout instead (see `selector_best_practices.md`).
